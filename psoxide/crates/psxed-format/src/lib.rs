//! Cooked-asset binary formats for PSoXide.
//!
//! This crate defines the on-disk layouts produced by the host
//! editor (`editor/crates/psxed`) and consumed by the MIPS-side
//! runtime parser (`sdk/crates/psx-asset`). Keeping the format
//! constants in a single crate that both sides depend on makes
//! it structurally impossible for producer + consumer to drift.
//!
//! The crate is **`no_std`** -- it compiles on every target we
//! ship to, host or PS1. It defines only:
//!
//! - Magic byte identifiers for each asset type
//! - Format-version constants
//! - `#[repr(C, packed)]` header structs laid out byte-exact to
//!   the file contents
//!
//! Encoders (host side) and decoders (PS1 side) live in
//! separate crates. This crate knows nothing about IO, serde,
//! or allocation -- it's a layout-only contract.
//!
//! ## Wire format
//!
//! Every cooked asset starts with a 12-byte common header:
//!
//! ```text
//!   offset  bytes  field
//!        0      4  magic    ASCII 4-char identifier (e.g. b"PSXM")
//!        4      2  version  u16 LE -- format revision, bumped on breakage
//!        6      2  flags    u16 LE -- asset-type-specific feature bits
//!        8      4  payload_len u32 LE -- size of the rest of the file
//! ```
//!
//! Each asset type appends its own payload after the header.
//! Payload layouts live in the per-type modules ([`mesh`]).
//!
//! ## Byte order
//!
//! All multi-byte integers are **little-endian**, matching PS1
//! / MIPS cooked order. Consumers on big-endian hosts would need
//! byte-swapping -- not a concern for our all-LE toolchain today.
