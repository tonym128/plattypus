//!
//!   Optional face palette-bank table: ceil(face_count / 4) bytes
//!     present when `flags::FACE_PALETTE_BANKS` is set in VERSION 5+

//!
//! Skinning is a hybrid model. Each part still owns one rigid bone
//! (its `joint_index`), and most triangles transform rigidly through
//! that bone -- fast GTE path. A vertex near a joint seam can name a
//! second bone in `joint1` along with a `blend` weight: the runtime
//! transforms that vertex by both bones and lerps the view-space
//! results, which keeps elbow and shoulder creases continuous instead
//! of opening into chunky gaps. `blend == 0` opts a vertex out of the
//! slow path entirely. VERSION 4 stores each skinned point once and
//! moves UVs onto face corners, so seams no longer need duplicate
//! vertices or a runtime weld pass. VERSION 5 optionally assigns one
//! of four 4bpp CLUT banks to each face without enlarging the face
//! record. Model-local coordinates are deliberately allowed to use a
//! much denser scale than world/grid coordinates; the header's
//! `local_to_world_q12` is the content pipeline's suggested conversion
//! for previews and simple runtime draw paths.
