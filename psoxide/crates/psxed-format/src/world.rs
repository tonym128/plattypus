//! Shared contract for cooked grid-world assets.
//!
//! Each `.psxw` blob is a fixed-size grid room: a world header, one
//! sector record per grid cell, then a compact wall table referenced
//! by sectors. Only `VERSION = 5` is emitted by the cooker; v1-v4
//! are legacy parser compatibility only.
//!
//! # Active format (VERSION = 5)
//!
//! - `[i32; 4]` heights per face -- 16 B per height set
//! - `QuadUvRecord` per floor / ceiling / wall -- 8 B per face
//! - 60 B sector record, 32 B wall record
//! - Wall records may store a non-quad shape in their 16-bit
//!   shape field, allowing one corner to be dropped for triangular
//!   vertical faces without changing the record size.
//! - Optional `HorizontalOverrideRecord` side table for floor /
//!   ceiling faces whose two split triangles have different material,
//!   UV, walkability, visibility, or triangle-local heights.
//! - Optional appended `SurfaceLightRecord` table when
//!   [`world_flags::STATIC_VERTEX_LIGHTING`] is set. The table is
//!   direct-indexed as `sector_count * 2` floor/ceiling slots,
//!   followed by one slot per wall record.
//! - No embedded material table; slot ids resolve via an external
//!   bank that the caller (engine / playtest manifest) supplies
//! - No sector logic stream, no portal records
//!
//! # Legacy format (VERSION = 4)
//!
//! - Active v3 header plus horizontal override side table for
//!   material, UV, walkability, and visibility, but no split
//!   triangle-local heights.
//!
//! # Legacy format (VERSION = 3)
//!
//! - 60 B sector record, 32 B wall record
//! - Per-face UVs and optional embedded vertex lighting.
//!
//! # Legacy format (VERSION = 2)
//!
//! - 60 B sector record, 32 B wall record
//! - Per-face UVs, but no embedded vertex lighting.
//!
//! # Legacy format (VERSION = 1)
//!
//! - 44 B sector record, 24 B wall record
//! - No UV records; readers synthesize the engine's default 64×64
//!   tile UVs.
//!
//! # Future compact format
//!
//! A more compact runtime format is sketched in
//! `docs/world-format-roadmap.md`. It does not live in this crate
//! as Rust types: `psxed-format` is the producer/consumer contract,
//! and a record only belongs here once both the cooker emits it
//! and the runtime parser accepts it. Until then the design stays
//! in docs.
