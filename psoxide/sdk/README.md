# `sdk/` (PSX SDK)

Bare-metal PlayStation 1 SDK: typed wrappers over the hardware with no
engine framework on top. This is the layer you use to write a PS1 program
directly (`_start`, GPU/SPU/GTE access, controller polling) without the
Scene/App machinery in the separate engine component.

The SDK is its own Cargo workspace (`sdk/Cargo.toml`). Code here targets
MIPS (`mipsel-sony-psx`); the GTE crates additionally build for the host so
the editor and emulator share one simulation.

## Crates

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [`psx-rt`](crates/psx-rt) | Bare-metal runtime: `_start`, BIOS calls, panic, heap, VBlank IRQ counter, corrected i64 builtins, scratchpad regions and scratchpad stacks. |
| [`psx-io`](crates/psx-io) | Volatile MMIO primitives for target code, plus the CD-ROM command surface. |
| [`psx-gpu`](crates/psx-gpu) | High-level GPU API: init, primitives, framebuffers, display-window shifting. |
| [`psx-vram`](crates/psx-vram) | Typed VRAM layout primitives: color, rect, tpage, CLUT, upload helpers. |
| [`psx-spu`](crates/psx-spu) | High-level SPU API: typed voices, volume, pitch, ADSR, ADPCM upload, key-on/off, loop chaining, noise. |
| [`psx-sfx`](crates/psx-sfx) | One-shot sample banks, voice allocation and playback cutoff for SPU effects. |
| [`psx-settings`](crates/psx-settings) | Versioned game preferences with optional memory-card persistence. |
| [`psx-gte`](crates/psx-gte) | GTE (COP2) wrappers. MIPS emits inline-asm coprocessor ops; host routes through `psx-gte-core`. |
| [`psx-gte-core`](crates/psx-gte-core) | Pure-Rust GTE state machine and fixed-point math. Shared by `psx-gte` and the emulator; bit-exact against a real-console conformance corpus. |
| [`psx-math`](crates/psx-math) | Fixed-point math: Q0.12 angles + sin/cos/atan2, int32 helpers, decimal text formatting. |
| [`psx-pad`](crates/psx-pad) | SIO0 controller polling: digital + DualShock analog, `PadTracker` edges/repeat, diagnostic pacing. |
| [`psx-font`](crates/psx-font) | Bitmap-font atlas: 1bpp source → 4bpp CLUT VRAM texture, GP0 textured-rect draw path. |
| [`psx-fx`](crates/psx-fx) | Arcade-style visual effects: particle pools, screen shake, deterministic RNG. |
| [`psx-asset`](crates/psx-asset) | Runtime parsers for cooked-asset blobs. Consumes `psxed-format` layouts produced by the editor. |
| [`psx-cache`](crates/psx-cache) | Generic no_std slot cache: keyed residency pool with LRU eviction and pinning. |
| [`psx-mc`](crates/psx-mc) | Memory-card driver: SIO0 transport, on-card filesystem format interoperable with the console's card manager, optional LZSS compression. |
| [`psx-osk`](crates/psx-osk) | On-screen keyboard for pad-driven text entry: QWERTY/symbols pages, shift, PS4-style boxed keys. |
| [`psx-pack`](crates/psx-pack) | Guest-side WORLD.PAK parsing + in-place HLZC/LZ4 decompression (reader half of `psx-iso`). |
| [`psx-telemetry`](crates/psx-telemetry) | Shared guest/host telemetry id tables for the emulator profiling hooks. |

There is no umbrella crate: games depend on the subsystem crates they use.
The workspace currently has 19 crates. A standalone game should use the
pinned bootstrap workflow described in the root README, rather than
copying SDK directories by hand; several shared dependencies still live
outside `sdk/`.

## Examples

Bare-metal programs in [`examples/`](examples), each its own workspace.
Build and run them via the top-level `Makefile` (see the
[root README](../README.md#build-a-triangle)).

| Example | Shows |
|---------|-------|
| `hello-tri` | A single GPU triangle. |
| `hello-tex` | Textured primitives + CLUT upload. |
| `hello-ot` | Ordering-table depth sorting. |
| `hello-input` | Controller polling via `psx-pad`. |
| `hello-gte` | GTE-accelerated transforms. |
| `hello-audio` | SPU voice playback. |
| `hello-cdda` | CD-DA audio tracks. |
| `hello-spstack` | A call tree run on a scratchpad stack under VBlank IRQs, checked against the RAM stack; `tools/stack_guard.py` proves it fits. |
| `hello-gteirq` | RTPS run under VBlank IRQs, checking that psx-rt's handler never runs a GTE command twice (a console run is the real test: the emulator never interrupts one). |
| `hello-present` | psx-rt's queued display flip, held until the frame's closing GP0(1Fh) sets GPUSTAT bit 24 (`arm_draw_done`, `end_with_draw_done`, `signal_draw_done`). |
