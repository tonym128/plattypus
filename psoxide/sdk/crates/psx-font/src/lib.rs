//! Bitmap-font atlases for the PS1.
//!
//! One crate, two types, three steps:
//!
//! 1. Declare (or pick) a [`BitmapFont`] -- a `static` descriptor
//!    that carries glyph dimensions, a 1-bit-per-pixel bitmap, and
//!    layout metadata (advance, line height, bit order). The
//!    built-in fonts in [`fonts`] cover Public-Domain IBM-VGA-style
//!    8×8 for ASCII / Latin-1 / box-drawing.
//!
//! 2. Upload it into VRAM once with [`FontAtlas::upload`] -- the
//!    crate picks a sensible atlas layout, expands the 1bpp source
//!    into a 4bpp CLUT texture, uploads that + a two-entry CLUT
//!    (transparent + white), and returns a handle.
//!
//! 3. Call one of the [`FontAtlas`] draw methods every frame. The
//!    same atlas supports both the fast rectangle path and the
//!    flexible quad path -- choose based on what the call needs.
//!
//! ## Draw-path cheat sheet
//!
//! | Method | Hardware | Cost / glyph | Does |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | [`FontAtlas::draw_text`] | GP0 0x64 textured rect | 4 words | 1:1 axis-aligned, single tint |
//! | [`FontAtlas::draw_text_scaled`] | GP0 0x2C textured quad | 9 words | Integer scale (2×, 3×, …), single tint |
//! | [`FontAtlas::draw_text_scaled_q8`] | GP0 0x2C textured quad | 9 words | Q8 fractional scale (1.5× = 384), single tint |
//! | [`FontAtlas::draw_text_rotated`] | GP0 0x2C textured quad | 9 words | Arbitrary angle rotation, single tint |
//! | [`FontAtlas::draw_text_affine`] | GP0 0x2C textured quad | 9 words | Arbitrary 2×2 matrix, single tint |
//! | [`FontAtlas::draw_text_gradient`] | GP0 0x3C gouraud-textured quad | 12 words | 1:1, top/bottom gradient |
//! | [`FontAtlas::draw_text_scaled_gradient`] | GP0 0x3C gouraud-textured quad | 12 words | Scaled + top/bottom gradient |
//!
//! `draw_text` is the fast default. Everything below it is a quad
//! primitive that pays ~2–3× the GP0 bandwidth for transforms or
//! per-corner colour. At PS1 scale, this matters for text-heavy UIs
//! (credit crawls, RPG dialogue walls) and doesn't for a HUD of a
//! few dozen glyphs. Callers pick consciously.
//!
//! All methods share the same atlas and CLUT -- no duplicate VRAM.
//! `draw_text_*` variants can freely mix in one frame, and tints
//! compose with the PSX per-texel multiplier (`output = texel *
//! tint / 128`).
//!
//! ## Generic over glyph dimensions
//!
//! Nothing in [`BitmapFont`] or [`FontAtlas`] hard-codes 8×8.
//! Declare a second font at 6×12 or 8×16, drop it into VRAM at a
//! different tpage, and you can mix sizes on the same screen.
//! What's size-dependent:
//!
//! - **Atlas layout**: the uploader picks `glyphs_per_row` so the
//!   atlas fits within its tpage.
//! - **Upload buffer**: the stack-only scratch buffer inside
//!   [`FontAtlas::upload`] is 16 KiB, enough for 128 glyphs at 16×16
//!   or 64 glyphs at 32×16. Larger atlases panic today; use
//!   [`upload_fonts`] with caller-owned scratch for them.
//!
//! ## Why 4bpp and not 15bpp direct
//!
//! 4bpp uses 1/4 the VRAM of 15bpp and opens the standard PSX
//! "colour a monochrome glyph via tint" trick. A 96-glyph ASCII
//! 8×8 atlas fits in 6×8 halfwords = 96 halfwords = 192 bytes of
//! VRAM. Direct-15bpp would be 768 bytes, and you'd lose the free
//! recolouring.
//!
//! ## Coordinate conventions
//!
//! - `draw_text` / `draw_text_scaled` / `draw_text_gradient`:
//!   `(x, y)` is the **top-left** of the string's first glyph.
//! - `draw_text_rotated`: `(cx, cy)` is the rotation **pivot** --
//!   the centre of the baseline. Positive angles rotate
//!   counter-clockwise in screen coords.
//! - `draw_text_affine`: `origin` is the point the 2×2 transform
//!   maps to the top-left of the first glyph. The matrix is applied
//!   in glyph-local space before translating to `origin`.
//!
//! ## Fixed-point conventions (rotation + affine)
//!
//! Rotation uses a Q0.12 angle: `u16` in `[0, 4096)` mapping to
//! `[0°, 360°)`. Sin/cos come from the shared SDK sin LUT in
//! [`psx_math::sincos`] -- see that crate for the precision /
//! Q-format specifics.
//!
//! Affine matrices are Q3.12 -- `i16` with 12 fractional bits, so
//! `4096` = 1.0, `-4096` = -1.0, `8192` = 2.0, and the usable
//! range is `±7.999…`. That's enough headroom for any visually
//! reasonable 2×2 transform a bitmap font would want.
