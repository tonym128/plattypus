//! Double-buffered framebuffer management.
//!
//! A `FrameBuffer` tracks two on-screen regions in VRAM -- one being
//! displayed, one being drawn into. `swap()` flips them at a VBlank
//! boundary. Layout is vertical: buffer A at Y=0, buffer B at Y=height.
//! That fits 2×(640×240) side-by-side inside the 1024×512 VRAM on
//! standard NTSC resolutions and gives the engine a natural tear-free
//! presentation.
