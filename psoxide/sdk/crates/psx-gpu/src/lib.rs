//! High-level PS1 GPU interface.
//!
//! Sits on top of `psx-io::gpu` + `psx-hw::gpu` constructors to expose
//! a friendlier API: `init()` to set up display mode, a small
//! primitives kit, and synchronisation (`draw_sync`, `vsync`, and the
//! GP0(1Fh) completion flag `draw_done` that psx-rt's queued flip tests).
//!
//! ## Primitives
//!
//! | Function                    | GP0 op | Words | Notes                          |
//! |-----------------------------|--------|-------|--------------------------------|
//! | [`fill_rect`]               | 0x02   | 3     | Ignores draw area, X %= 16.    |
//! | [`draw_tri_flat`]           | 0x20   | 4     | Single colour.                 |
//! | [`draw_tri_gouraud`]        | 0x30   | 6     | Per-vertex colour.             |
//! | [`draw_quad_flat`]          | 0x28   | 5     | Single colour.                 |
//! | [`draw_line_mono`]          | 0x40   | 3     | Rasterised line, any slope.    |
//! | [`draw_line_gouraud`]       | 0x50   | 4     | Gouraud line.                  |
//! | [`draw_quad_textured`]      | 0x2C   | 9     | Flat tint, free UV per vertex. |
//! | [`draw_quad_textured_gouraud`] | 0x3C | 12   | Per-vertex colour × texel.     |
//! | [`draw_sprite_material`]    | 0x64   | 4     | Material-aware textured sprite. |
//!
//! Textured rectangles (GP0 0x64..=0x7F) are the fastest path for
//! axis-aligned 1:1 sprites. [`draw_sprite_material`] covers the
//! common variable-size sprite path; `psx-font` layers atlas helpers
//! on top. The [`material`] module groups packed CLUT/tpage words
//! with tint and blend state.
//!
//! ## Why split like this
//!
//! Keeping the low-level constructors in `psx-hw` means the same
//! encoding is shared with the emulator's GPU decoder -- both sides
//! can't drift out of sync on command layout. `psx-gpu` adds the
//! thin ergonomic layer: `wait_cmd_ready()` + `write_gp0()`
//! sequencing, typed depth enums, vertex/UV packing.
