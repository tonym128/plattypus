//! Ordering Table: depth-sorted linked-list of GPU primitives.
//!
//! The PS1 has no Z-buffer. Games sort primitives back-to-front
//! (painter's algorithm) by inserting them into an OT slot indexed
//! by depth. Each OT slot is the head of a linked list; primitives
//! prepend themselves so the most-recently-inserted draws first
//! within a slot.
//!
//! Once a frame's primitives are inserted, the whole OT is shipped
//! to GPU GP0 via DMA channel 2 in linked-list mode. The DMA walker
//! follows the `next` pointers embedded in each packet's first word
//! until it hits `0x00FFFFFF` (end of chain).
//!
//! Each 32-bit OT entry (and primitive header) is:
//!
//! ```text
//!   bits 0..=23: address of next packet (24-bit, masked into RAM)
//!   bits 24..=31: word count of this packet's data, at most
//!                 `crate::MAX_NODE_WORDS` (16) on silicon
//! ```
//!
//! An "empty OT" has every entry pointing at its predecessor,
//! ending in `0x00FFFFFF`. Submitting such an OT sends nothing to
//! GP0. As primitives are added, their packets chain in.
