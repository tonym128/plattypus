//! GTE -- Geometry Transformation Engine (COP2).
//!
//! 32 data registers + 32 control registers, all in fixed-point.
//! Vertices and matrix elements are signed 1.3.12 (`i16` × 1/4096);
//! translations and color-bias terms are signed 31.0; intermediate
//! accumulation runs in 64-bit signed with a 44-bit overflow check
//! before truncation to 32-bit `MAC1..3`.
//!
//! Each function call clears `FLAG`, runs its math (which may set the
//! per-result saturation/overflow bits), then folds the error bits
//! into the master `FLAG[31]`. Software polls `FLAG` to detect
//! geometry that would otherwise wrap or clip incorrectly.
//!
//! The division used by `RTPS`/`RTPT` is the documented unsigned
//! Newton-Raphson iteration off a 257-entry seed table -- keeping the
//! exact PSX algorithm matters because games consume the resulting
//! `SX2`/`SY2` values directly and any drift moves vertices on screen.
//!
//! Reference: nocash PSX-SPX, section "GTE Coprocessor". Cross-checked
//! against PCSX-Redux's `gte.cc` interpreter.
//!
//! ## Provenance
//!
//! Implemented from public hardware documentation (nocash PSX-SPX, "GTE
//! Coprocessor") and parity-verified against PCSX-Redux's `gte.cc`
//! (<https://github.com/grumpycoders/pcsx-redux>), GPL-2.0-or-later. The
//! division seed table and saturation rules are hardware behaviour.
//! PSoXide is released under GPL-2.0-or-later for compatibility with that
//! reference; see `LICENSE` and `docs/license-audit.md`.
