//! Up-to-3-directional-light rig, rendered via the GTE's
//! hardware lighting pipeline (`NCCS` / `NCDS` / `NCS` ops).
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! Each [`Light`] is a *directional* light -- a direction vector
//! + an RGB intensity. The PSX GTE evaluates lighting as:
//!
//! ```text
//!   IR   = LLM * V0                         (N dot each light direction)
//!   IR   = [BK] * 0x1000 + LCM * IR         (mix light colours + ambient)
//!   MAC  = IR * RGBC                        (modulate by material/vertex colour)
//!   RGB2 = MAC                              (push to RGB FIFO, readable as u32)
//! ```
//!
//! - `LLM` (light direction matrix, 3×3): each **row** is one
//!   light's direction vector.
//! - `LCM` (light colour matrix, 3×3): each **column** is one
//!   light's RGB contribution (so `LCM * IR` mixes light colours
//!   weighted by the corresponding dot-product magnitudes).
//! - `BK` (background colour, 3×i32): ambient term added
//!   before the material multiply.
//! - `RGBC` (data reg 6): per-vertex material / palette tint --
//!   the GTE multiplies the lit colour by this before emitting.
//!
//! # Object-local vs world-space lights
//!
//! The GTE operates on normals in their native mesh space
//! (typically object-local). Lights packed into LLM therefore
//! also need to be in object-local space for the dot products to
//! come out right. Use [`LightRig::for_object`] once per object
//! per frame to pre-rotate world-space lights into its local
//! frame.
//!
//! # Cost
//!
//! - Rig upload (`load`): ~20 CTC2 writes per frame (cheap).
//! - Per-object rotate: 9 integer multiplies × 3 lights = 27 mul
//!   + 9 adds on the CPU -- still cheap next to projection cost.
//! - Per vertex: 2 MTC2 + 1 RTPS + 2 MTC2 + 1 MTC2 + 1 NCCS + 3
//!   MFC2 ≈ 10 GTE ops, ~30-40 cycles total.
//! - Batched projection: `project_lit_triangle` uses RTPT for three
//!   positions, then NCCS per normal/material. This keeps per-vertex
//!   lighting identical while replacing three RTPS ops with one RTPT.
//!   If the three material tints match, it also uses NCCT to batch
//!   the three NCCS lighting ops.

///      `IR0`, pushes RGB FIFO.
///
/// After the loop:
///   5. `NCLIP` -- reads SXY0/1/2 from the FIFO, flags back-face.
///   6. `AVSZ3` -- reads SZ1/2/3, computes the OT-slot key.
