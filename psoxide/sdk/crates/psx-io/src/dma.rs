//! DMA controller MMIO.
//!
//! The PS1 has 7 DMA channels (MDEC-in, MDEC-out, GPU, CD-ROM, SPU,
//! PIO, OTC). Each channel has three registers -- `MADR` (memory
//! address), `BCR` (block count), `CHCR` (control) -- at fixed
//! 16-byte strides starting at `0x1F80_1080`. Plus global `DPCR`
//! (priority/enable) at `0x1F80_10F0` and `DICR` (IRQ) at `0x1F80_10F4`.
