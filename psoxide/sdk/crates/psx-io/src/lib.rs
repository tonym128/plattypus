//! `write_volatile` in zero-overhead helpers that each peripheral
//! module builds on. Keeping these centralised means we can audit
//! every MMIO touchpoint in one file.
//!
//! All functions here are `#[inline(always)]` and `unsafe` -- they
//! accept arbitrary addresses and widths. Higher-level SDK crates
//! present safe APIs on top of these.
