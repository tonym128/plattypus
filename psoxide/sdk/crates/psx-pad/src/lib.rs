//! Digital / DualShock pad polling via SIO0.
//!
//! Talks directly to the SIO0 hardware (no BIOS syscalls) so the
//! same code works whether we side-load a homebrew (HLE BIOS) or
//! boot through the real BIOS. The controller protocol is simple
//! enough that a hand-rolled select + four-byte exchange beats
//! opening events and waiting on them.
//!
//! Typical use from a game loop:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use psx_pad::poll_port1;
//!
//! let pad = poll_port1();
//! if pad.buttons.is_held(psx_pad::button::START) {
//!     // …
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The protocol spec, reproduced from nocash PSX-SPX:
//!
//! | `TX` | `RX` | Meaning                            |
//! |------|------|------------------------------------|
//! | `01` | `FF` | Address byte / select controller   |
//! | `42` | `41` | Poll command / digital pad ID low  |
//! | `00` | `5A` | Fill byte / ID high                |
//! | `00` | `b0` | Buttons group 1 (active-low)       |
//! | `00` | `b1` | Buttons group 2 (active-low)       |
//!
//! DualShock analog mode uses the same first four bytes but reports
//! ID low `0x73` and appends four stick bytes:
//! right X/Y, then left X/Y. Fresh DualShocks boot digital, so games
//! that require sticks should either call [`enable_analog_port1`] or
//! show an "enable analog mode" prompt when [`PadState::is_analog`]
//! is false.
//!
//! Our [`ButtonState`] stores active-high so `buttons.is_held` feels
//! natural in game code.
