//! Provides the `_start` entry point that the PSX-EXE loader jumps to,
//! a panic handler, direct i-cache control, a BIOS TTY debug
//! trampoline, and optional heap initialisation. Homebrew crates
//! depend on this crate to get a working `main()` environment without
//! thinking about linker symbols or cache-flushing.
//!
//! # Entry sequence
//!
//! 1. The loader (our emulator or the real BIOS) copies the EXE
//!    payload to `LOAD_ADDR` and jumps to [`_start`].
//! 2. [`_start`] zeroes the `.bss` section using the linker-defined
//!    `__bss_start` / `__bss_end` symbols.
//! 3. With the `alloc` feature, the bump allocator is seeded from
//!    `__heap_start..__heap_end`.
//! 4. `main()` is called. When it returns, we halt.
