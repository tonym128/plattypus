//! The CPU scratchpad, and running code with its stack there.
//!
//! The R3000A has no data cache. Its 1 KiB scratchpad at `0x1F80_0000` is
//! the only data memory that loads from in one cycle; a main-RAM load stalls
//! for about six. Code whose frames spill a lot (long loops with more live
//! values than callee-saved registers, explicit work stacks in a frame) pays
//! that stall on every stack reload. [`ScratchpadStack::run`] moves `$sp`
//! into a scratchpad region for one call, so the same instructions run with
//! their frames in fast memory. Nothing about the code changes, only where
//! its frames live, so results are identical by construction. On Cortex,
//! running face selection, collision traces and the model face walker this
//! way cut gameplay work 3.9% in the emulator (2026-09-22). No console has
//! run it yet.
//!
//! # Sharing the scratchpad
//!
//! Games and the engine already keep working sets in the scratchpad (clip
//! planes, batch workspaces, bucket heads), usually in phases that reuse the
//! same bytes. There is deliberately no allocator. Instead each user names
//! its bytes as a const [`Region`], and every set of regions that is live at
//! the same time is checked once at compile time with [`assert_disjoint`]:
//!
//! ```
//! use psx_rt::scratchpad::{assert_disjoint, Region, ScratchpadStack};
//!
//! // Persistent across the whole frame.
//! const BUCKET_HEADS: Region = Region::new(0, 128);
//! // Face pass only: clip planes, then the batch workspace.
//! const CLIP_PLANES: Region = Region::new(128, 224);
//! const BATCH: Region = Region::new(224, 1024);
//! // Selection runs before the face pass claims its bytes.
//! type SelectionStack = ScratchpadStack<128, 1024>;
//!
//! const _: () = assert_disjoint(&[BUCKET_HEADS, CLIP_PLANES, BATCH]);
//! const _: () = assert_disjoint(&[BUCKET_HEADS, SelectionStack::REGION]);
//! ```
//!
//! A stack region may overlap a phase's region only when that phase is not
//! live around the call, and the second `assert_disjoint` is the written
//! record of which regions are.
//!
//! # What makes it safe
//!
//! * Interrupts. psx-rt's exception handler (installed by
//!   `interrupts::install_vblank_counter`) uses only `$k0`/`$k1` and
//!   never touches `$sp`, so an IRQ taken on a scratchpad stack writes
//!   nothing there and returns to the same `$sp`. A game that runs with a
//!   different handler installed must check that it does not push onto the
//!   interrupted stack, and then says so with
//!   [`declare_stack_safe_handler`](crate::interrupts::declare_stack_safe_handler)
//!   (hk-psx's CD wrapper saves to its own context, runs on its own stack
//!   and chains to psx-rt's handler). The `scratchpad-stack-check` feature
//!   traps a call made with interrupts enabled and any other handler in
//!   the vector.
//! * Stack depth. The whole call tree of `f` must fit in the region minus
//!   [`STACK_OVERHEAD`] ([`ScratchpadStack::BUDGET`]). `tools/stack_guard.py`
//!   proves it from the linked image after every build: it finds each
//!   monomorphised [`ScratchpadStack`] entry, sums frame sizes down the static
//!   call graph, and fails on overflow, recursion, calls through a register
//!   and BIOS calls, none of which it can bound. The `scratchpad-stack-check`
//!   feature adds a canary word at the bottom of the region, checked after
//!   every call.
//! * Panics. SDK guests build with `panic = "abort"`, so nothing unwinds
//!   through the switch. With `panic_immediate_abort` a panic is a BREAK the
//!   exception handler halts on. Otherwise psx-rt's panic handler moves `$sp`
//!   back to the RAM stack before it prints, so reporting never runs on (or
//!   overflows) the scratchpad.
//! * Nesting. A call made while already on a scratchpad stack runs `f` in
//!   place, and the guard counts it as part of the outer call tree.
