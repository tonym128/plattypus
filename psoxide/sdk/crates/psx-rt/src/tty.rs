//! TTY output for debug printing.
//!
//! The PS1 BIOS has a `putchar` handler that forwards bytes to the
//! Expansion 2 TTY port -- PCSX-Redux reads that port and prints to
//! stdout. Our emulator does the same. So calling [`print`] /
//! [`println`] from homebrew lands in the host terminal, which is
//! the canonical PS1 debug channel.
