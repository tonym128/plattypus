//! Sample playback and shared voice management on the SPU.
//!
//! Four programs on the PSoXide demo disc grew their own copy of this: the
//! launcher, VoXide, NitroXide and the Celeste collection. Three of them are
//! not engine applications, so the helpers in `psx-engine` were out of reach
//! and each rewrote the same three things. That mattered more than the
//! duplication itself, because what they were rewriting is the part emulators
//! get wrong:
//!
//! * A one-shot's repeat address has to be written by hand. Silicon latches it
//!   only from a block carrying the loop-start flag, and a one-shot has none,
//!   so it otherwise keeps whatever the previous sound left there and the
//!   voice ends up playing an unrelated sample. [`psx_spu::Voice::
//!   configure_sample`] does this now; going through it is the point.
//! * A one-shot does not stop itself. END drops the voice into RELEASE at the
//!   ADSR's release rate rather than muting it, so a slow release leaves the
//!   voice running audibly past its own data. A fast release hides that, which
//!   is why the bug survived so long: the Celeste collection is inaudibly
//!   wrong rather than right. The honest fix is to silence the voice on a
//!   clock, which is what [`Player::tick`] does.
//! * Voices have to be shared out, or a new sound cuts off the one before it.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut bank = Bank::new(SpuAddr::new(0x1010));
//! let blip = bank.upload(include_bytes!("blip.psau"));
//! let mut player: Player<3> = Player::new([Voice::V0, Voice::V1, Voice::V2], 60);
//!
//! // once a frame
//! player.tick(tick);
//! if pressed { player.play(&OneShot::new(blip, Volume::HALF), tick); }
//! ```
