//! High-level PS1 SPU (Sound Processing Unit) API.
//!
//! Turns SPU-programming-by-magic-numbers into typed primitives:
//!
//! - [`Voice`] -- typed voice index in `0..24`.
//! - [`Pitch`] -- Q5.12 sample-rate multiplier; `Pitch::UNITY` =
//!   44100 Hz (one sample per SPU tick).
//! - [`Volume`] -- per-voice / main-output signed linear gain.
//! - [`CdVolume`] -- CD-DA / XA input signed Q15 gain.
//! - [`Adsr`] -- typed envelope descriptor; builds the two-word SPU
//!   envelope register pair.
//! - [`SpuAddr`] -- 8-byte-aligned SPU RAM pointer (the only shape
//!   voice-start / loop / transfer registers accept).
//!
//! Typical boot sequence:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! spu::init();                              // turn the SPU on, sensible defaults
//! spu::set_main_volume(Volume::MAX, Volume::MAX);
//! spu::upload_adpcm(SpuAddr::new(0x1010), &TONE_SAMPLE);
//! let v = Voice::V0;
//! v.set_volume(Volume::MAX, Volume::MAX);
//! v.set_pitch(Pitch::UNITY);
//! v.set_start_addr(SpuAddr::new(0x1010));
//! v.set_adsr(Adsr::default_tone());
//! Voice::key_on(v.mask());                  // start the tone
//! ```
//!
//! ## What this crate owns vs doesn't
//!
//! - **Owns**: typed register access, key-on/off masks, the ADPCM
//!   byte-stream upload path, ADSR encoding helpers, sample-start
//!   address alignment.
//! - **Doesn't own (yet)**: ADPCM encoder (ship pre-baked samples
//!   instead -- see `vendor/tone_*.adpcm`, or cook `.psau` with
//!   `psxed audio-pack`), reverb preset tables, DMA-based sample
//!   upload. Those land as the ladder pulls them in.
//!
//! ## Q-format conventions
//!
//! - **Pitch**: Q5.12 in a u16. `0x1000` = 1.0 = the sample plays
//!   at its recorded rate (44100 Hz). Halving to `0x0800` drops an
//!   octave; `0x2000` raises one. Pitch field is 14 bits on
//!   hardware; values above `0x3FFF` clamp.
//! - **Volumes**: i16. Sign carries, the magnitude is linear. Max
//!   output is `0x3FFF` (= 1.0); `Volume::MAX` already uses this.
//!   Negative means "phase-inverted," used for stereo tricks we
//!   don't wire up here yet.
//! - **CD volumes**: signed Q15. Max input gain is `0x7FFF`, exposed
//!   as `CdVolume::MAX`.
//! - **SPU RAM addresses**: stored in registers as `addr / 8`,
//!   [`SpuAddr`] does the divide so the caller passes byte offsets.
