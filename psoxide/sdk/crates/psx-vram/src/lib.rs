//! Typed VRAM primitives.
//!
//! PS1 VRAM is a 1024×512 halfword frame, and getting a sprite
//! on screen is three interlocking decisions: *where* the texel
//! bytes live, *where* the CLUT lives, and *what* format you're
//! in. PsyQ leaves those as `short` variables you pass around by
//! convention. This crate promotes them to types.
//!
//! ## What's here
//!
//! - [`Color555`] -- a 15bpp BGR pixel. Constructed via
//!   [`Color555::rgb8`] (`u8` RGB → 5-bit truncation), or
//!   [`Color555::rgb5`] (already 5-bit), or the `const` raw
//!   constructor [`Color555::raw`].
//! - [`VramRect`] -- an `(x, y, w, h)` in VRAM pixels with const
//!   validation of the bounds. Can't construct one that would
//!   overflow VRAM.
//! - [`Tpage`] -- a texture-page handle. Const constructor
//!   enforces the PSX alignment rules (`x % 64 == 0`, `y ∈ {0, 256}`),
//!   knows its bit-depth, and emits the GP0(E1h) draw-mode word
//!   or the 16-bit tpage field embedded in textured-rect UV words.
//! - [`Clut`] -- a CLUT handle. `x % 16 == 0`, `y ∈ 0..512`. Emits
//!   the 16-bit clut field for UV words. 4bpp and 8bpp CLUTs are
//!   the same underlying type -- the calling primitive's tpage
//!   picks which entry count it uses.
//! - [`upload_16bpp`] -- safe upload wrapper: checks `pixels.len()`
//!   matches `rect.w * rect.h`, packs to GP0 0xA0 + word stream.
//!
//! ## What's NOT here (yet)
//!
//! - Compile-time tpage-overlap detection. A later pass can wrap
//!   allocations in a const-generic `Layout<...>` that enforces
//!   non-overlap across a fixed set of Tpage/Clut declarations;
//!   kept out for now because the rules around the 16-pixel CLUT
//!   stride + tpage-row sharing get messy to express in bare
//!   Rust const generics, and a build-time allocator tool is a
//!   cleaner path when we're ready.
//! - TIM parsing. Runtime / proc-macro loading lives in
//!   `psx-asset` when it lands.
//! - 4bpp / 8bpp upload helpers. PsyQ packs those as 16-bit
//!   halfwords too (4 / 2 texels per halfword); the same
//!   `upload_16bpp` works once the caller has pre-packed the
//!   indices. A typed `upload_4bpp(rect, &[u8], clut)` would be
//!   nicer; it's one of the first obvious follow-ups.
//!
//! ## Why these types over PsyQ's shorts
//!
//! Every field has rules PsyQ leaves to the programmer. Tpage X
//! must be a multiple of 64; Y must be 0 or 256. CLUT X must be
//! a multiple of 16. Upload sizes are clamped on hardware but
//! wrap (wrap, not truncate) on the real DMA controller if you
//! oversize them. Getting any of these wrong in PsyQ silently
//! corrupts VRAM. Const-validating them at construction means
//! the bug can't compile -- which is the whole point of writing
//! a Rust SDK instead of a C one.
