"""Fix R3000 load-delay hazards in a linked PS-EXE without moving any code.

LLVM's MIPS delay-slot filler can leave a load in a branch delay slot whose
destination the next executed instruction reads; the R3000 has no load
interlock, so that instruction sees the stale register. Rebuilding with the
filler disabled costs tens of kilobytes of nops, which some guests cannot
afford. This tool instead reroutes every hazardous branch through a small
trampoline, so the consumer runs at least three instructions after the load:

    j    T            ->  j    TRAMP        TRAMP: nop ; j T ; nop
    jal  F            ->  jal  TRAMP        TRAMP: nop ; j F ; nop
    bXX  rs[,rt], T   ->  j    TRAMP        TRAMP: bXX rs[,rt], +3 ; nop
                                                   j FALL ; nop
                                                   j T    ; nop

The delay-slot load stays where it is and still executes exactly once. The
conditional form re-evaluates the branch inside the trampoline, which is
sound because the slot instruction writes only its own destination and the
tool refuses any site where that destination is a branch source.

A register jump's consumer is not in the image: `jr ra` returns into every
caller, `jalr` calls an unknown function, and a `jr` whose jump table cannot
be resolved goes somewhere unknown. Those move the load out of the slot
instead, so it runs two instructions before the jump lands:

    jr   rs ; LOAD    ->  j TRAMP ; nop    TRAMP: LOAD ; jr rs ; nop
    jalr rs ; LOAD    ->  j TRAMP ; nop    TRAMP: LOAD ; jalr rs ; nop
                                                  j NEXT ; nop

`j` touches no register and nothing runs between the original address setup
and the load, so the load reads the same operands. The callee of the `jalr`
returns into the trampoline, which jumps back to the original return address.
A load that writes the jump register itself is refused, and `jr ra` loading
ra is left alone (the caller never reads ra before restoring it). So is a
`jalr` slot load that reads the link register: the jalr writes it before its
slot runs, so the load reads the new return address, and hoisted ahead of the
jalr it would read the old one. A load reading the jump register is fine for
both shapes, since neither jump writes it. The other shapes keep the load in
its slot after the same (or, for `jal`, an identically linking) instruction.

The trampolines live in a `.data` array the guest declares:

    #[no_mangle] #[used]
    pub static mut HAZARD_TRAMPOLINES: [u32; 2 + N] = { magic 0x48415a54, N, 0.. };

    python3 hazard_patch.py game.exe          # patch in place
    python3 hazard_patch.py game.exe --check  # report only, exit 1 on hazards
    python3 hazard_patch.py game.exe --map game.map

With `--map` (ld.lld's `-Map` output for the same link) a switch's jump
table is proven, required to lie in `.rodata`, and bounded to its own
function, as the stack guard does (see `jump_table`). Without it a table
is found only from the dispatch's own straight-line block (see `Block`), a
dispatch whose table base comes from farther away is unresolved (its slot
load moves out of the slot), and a table may read into a neighbouring one,
which only adds harmless detours.
A map from another link is refused (see `LinkMap.check`).
Scan an image patched with `--map` with `hazard_scan.py --map` too: without
the map the scanner may read into the next tables again and report the
detours it skipped.

Exit status is non-zero when a hazard cannot be patched, the array is missing
or full, or the rescan after patching still finds one. Needs
mipsel-none-elf-objdump on PATH, or another one named in OBJDUMP.

This file is also the one hazard detector: hazard_scan.py imports
`find_hazards` and its helpers from here, so a hazard class added once is seen
by both tools (two separate copies drifted and each missed a class, branch
operands 2026-09-04 and `jr ra` / `jalr` / unresolved `jr` 2026-09-22), and
tools/test_hazard_tools.py fails if their reports ever differ. It stays
self-contained, so a one-file copy still works; a game should still call the
SDK's copy from its hydrated `.psoxide/tools/` rather than vendor it.

class Flow:
    """Proves where a `jr` switch dispatch reads its target, from the
    control flow of one function of a linked image and its link map.

    The table address is a constant LLVM loads once per switch (`lui`, maybe
    `addiu`, often hoisted out of a loop into a callee-saved register), and
    it holds on every path the compiler laid out to the dispatch. So the
    proof walks back from the `jr` along edges that are certainly in the
    compiled code, and every write of the base register it reaches must
    compute the same constant. The edges:

    * fall-through, and branches and jumps within the function or through
      its hazard trampolines;
    * past a call, only for a callee-saved register and only when the
      callee can return (it has a `jr` or jumps out); after a noreturn call
      (a panic) the next word is some other block, often a switch case;
    * from a switch whose table is already proven to each case it lists.

    A path that reaches something the image cannot show is unknown, and the
    dispatch stays unresolved: an argument, $sp or $ra at the function's
    first instruction, a branch in from other code, an undecodable word.
    A path is dropped when the o32 ABI says compiled code never reads a
    value along it (a register a call may change, a register that carries
    nothing into the function). Dropping a real edge can only lose a proof;
    following one that is not real could find a wrong write, which is why
    the edges above are restricted to ones the code has. The last kind can
    overshoot: until the next table of the function is proven, a table seems
    to run on into it and lends that table's cases to the wrong switch. The
    writes such a path finds must still agree with every other; a wrong
    proof needs every real path to dead-end and the lent ones to agree on
    another constant whose table also jumps only into the function.

    A table must start inside a `.rodata*` input section of the map. LLVM
    emits every switch table there, and psoxide.ld links `.rodata.*` into
    the same `.data` output section as mutable `.data.*`: a `static mut`
    array of code pointers indexed by `lw` reads like a table, but what the
    image holds is only its initial value, so proving jump targets from it,
    or patching an entry, would be wrong. Unresolved, its dispatch gets the
    safe trampoline that moves the slot load out.

    Nothing else bounds a table in the image: an index that is an enum tag
    has no range check (hk-psx frame::simulate). A proven table runs to the
    next proven table's start, the end of its `.rodata` section, or its
    first word that does not jump into the function past its first
    instruction (a switch never jumps to its function's entry, and a
    function pointer names nothing else); tables sit back to back in the
    function's `.rodata`, and reading on would take the next function's
    table for this one's (hk-psx, 2026-09-23: presentation::service's table
    ran into menu::run's). An entry may be a
    `nop ; j T ; nop` trampoline into the function: an earlier patch
    pointed it there. Every switch of a function is proven together, round
    by round (one that sits in another's case is only reached through that
    one's table); then each proof is checked again with the final tables,
    and one that no longer holds is dropped and the rounds resume.

    On the hk-psx, Quake and GoldSrc images it was checked against
    (2026-09-23), every table proven this way lies inside its function's own
    `.rodata.<function>` section, and together they cover each such section
    exactly."""
