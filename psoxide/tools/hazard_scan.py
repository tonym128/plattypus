"""Scan a PS-EXE for R3000 load-delay hazards created by branch delay slots.

The R3000 has no load interlock: the instruction after a load still sees the
register's old value. LLVM inserts the required nop after a load, but its
MipsDelaySlotFiller can then hoist that load into a branch delay slot, and the
first instruction of the branch target (or of the fall-through) reads the
register one instruction too early. A guest either passes
`-Cllvm-args=-disable-mips-df-backward-search`, which stops the hoist and
leaves a nop in most delay slots, or keeps every filler search on and runs
`tools/hazard_patch.py` after the link (`tools/sdk-examples.mk` does the
latter). This scan proves an image is clean, whatever built it.

    python3 tools/hazard_scan.py path/to/game.exe [more.exe ...]
    python3 tools/hazard_scan.py path/to/game.exe --map path/to/game.map

Prints every hazard as `branch | delay-slot load | consumer` and exits 1 if
any image has one. Needs mipsel-none-elf-objdump on PATH, or another one named
in OBJDUMP. Loads into $zero (cache probes) are ignored, and so is anything
within 16 words of a byte pattern that does not decode as an instruction: a
PS-EXE carries its tables and assets in the same load, and those decode as
random branches. Addresses come from the header's load address, so a raw blob
linked elsewhere (the demo disc's chain loader at 0x801F0000) can be scanned
once a PS-EXE header naming that address is put in front of it. Detection is
imported from hazard_patch.py, the same code the patcher patches from, and
`--map` (one image only) resolves jump tables as `hazard_patch.py --map` does.
Without it, an image with register jumps gets a one-line warning: its tables
are then read from each dispatch's own block and none is proven.

It also warns, without failing, about a GTE command (COP2 `cofun`) in a
branch delay slot. An interrupt taken on a GTE command lets it run and leaves
EPC on it; psx-rt's handler steps over it (hardware-tests v1.24, cases
0xC9/0xCB), but in a delay slot EPC names the branch, so the branch and the
command both run again. psx-spx's answer is to keep GTE commands out of
delay slots; LLVM never puts inline asm there, so a hit is hand-written asm
or data that decodes as code.

A slot load whose consumer cannot be seen from the image counts as a hazard,
because nothing here can prove it safe:

    jr ra        the value lands on the caller's first instruction, and a
                 function reached through a pointer has no call site to check
                 (cs-psx's settings getters drew stale values through this
                 shape, 2026-09-15; hl-psx's `settings::value` has it too)
    jalr rs      the callee is unknown, so is its first instruction
    jr rs        a register jump whose jump table cannot be resolved
