//! Hydrate a pinned PSoXide source tree into a game repository.
//!
//! Games that build against this SDK have to reach it somehow, and the demo
//! disc had grown three answers. Half-Life pinned a git rev in Cargo.lock and
//! copied the resolved checkout into a local cache. NitroXide, PSXcel, the
//! Celeste collection and GH-PSX each vendored the whole repository as a
//! submodule. VoXide used a relative path that only resolves inside the demo
//! disc superproject.
//!
//! The vendored ones drifted, which is the argument. Bumping four submodules by
//! hand is a chore nobody does, so three of them sat eight commits behind a
//! measured SPU fix. This is Half-Life's answer, generalised, so no game has to
//! write it again:
//!
//! * Cargo owns the pin. A git dependency on a crate from this repository puts
//!   a rev in the game's lockfile, and cargo caches the checkout once per
//!   machine rather than once per game.
//! * `cargo metadata` says where that checkout landed, and this copies it to a
//!   stable path so plain `path = "..."` dependencies and the linker script
//!   both resolve.
//! * `--from` overrides the pin with a working tree, which is what lets the
//!   demo disc force every program onto one SDK regardless of what each game
//!   pinned for itself.
//!
//! It is a build step rather than a `build.rs` because Cargo resolves manifests
//! before it runs build scripts: by the time a build script could hydrate
//! anything, the path dependencies it was meant to satisfy have already failed
//! to resolve.
