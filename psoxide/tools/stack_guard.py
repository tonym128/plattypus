"""Prove every scratchpad stack call tree in a linked PS-EXE fits its region.

`psx_rt::scratchpad::ScratchpadStack::<START, END>::run(f)` runs `f` with $sp
in scratchpad bytes START..END. Nothing at run time can stop a deep call tree
from running off the bottom of the region into another scratchpad user's
bytes (or off the scratchpad), and an inlining change can grow a tree by
hundreds of bytes without any source change (a profile-guided hl-psx build
grew its projection chain from 568 to 824). This walks the linked image's
static call graph from every monomorphised entry,

    <psx_rt::scratchpad::ScratchpadStack<START, END>>::stack_entry::<R, F>

sums frame sizes (every `addiu sp,sp,-N`; a tail call counts as a call, which
only overestimates) down the deepest path, and fails
when the total exceeds the region minus psx-rt's 20-byte overhead (16 bytes
of o32 argument home area, one canary word). It also fails on what it cannot
bound: recursion, calls through a register (`jalr`, dyn and fn pointers),
register jumps it cannot prove are a switch (BIOS calls go through `jr` to
0xA0/0xB0/0xC0), and $sp adjusted any other way.

A switch's `jr` is proven from the map by hazard_patch.py's `jump_table`
(see its `Flow`): the table's address is followed back through the
function however far away it was loaded, and the table ends at its first
entry that leaves the function. A proven switch calls nothing, since every
entry lands inside its own function. Before, a table read on into the next
function's table, whose cases then counted as calls (hk-psx's input polling
pulled in the menu and memory card code), and a base loaded more than a few
instructions before the dispatch could not be resolved at all.

    python3 tools/stack_guard.py game.exe game.map
    python3 tools/stack_guard.py game.exe game.map --root REGEX --budget BYTES

The map is ld.lld's `-Map` output for the same link (the editor writes it
with PSOXIDE_GUEST_LINK_MAP; psoxide-pgo has every link it builds write one
and runs this tool with it, which covers `make example`). The
exe may be hazard-patched: calls rerouted through HAZARD_TRAMPOLINES are
followed to their targets. `--root`/`--budget` check a game's own stack
switch instead (an entry name regex and its byte budget), for code that
predates psx-rt's. Without a map the tool only checks that the image does not
contain psx-rt's stack switch, so a guest that starts using it cannot skip
the proof by not writing a map.

Two callees are counted without descending: psx-rt's switch trampoline
`__psx_rt_call_on_stack` (a nested `run` calls `f` in place at run time; the
trampoline path is never taken there, and if it were it would switch stacks)
and the panic handler (`rust_begin_unwind`), which moves $sp back to the RAM
stack before it reports. Each still counts its own frame.

Needs mipsel-none-elf-objdump on PATH, or another one named in OBJDUMP.
